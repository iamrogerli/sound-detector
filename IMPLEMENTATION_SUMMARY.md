# Sound Detection App - Implementation Summary

## Overview

This document summarizes the complete implementation of the Sound Detection App with all three requested features:

1. **Feature 1**: Record sound for 5 seconds and save to audio file
2. **Feature 2**: Train a model to recognize sounds
3. **Feature 3**: Listen for specific sounds from microphone

## Architecture

The application follows a modular architecture with clear separation of concerns:

## Feature Implementations

### Feature 1: Audio Recording

**Files**: `src/audio_utils.py`, `src/audio_recorder.py`

**Key Components**:
- `AudioRecorder`: Core recording functionality
- `RecordingManager`: File management and organization
- `SimpleRecorder`: Easy-to-use recording interface

**Functionality**:
- Record exactly 5 seconds of audio
- Save recordings as WAV files with timestamps
- Organize recordings by sound type
- Play back recordings for verification
- Manage recording files (list, delete, info)

**Usage Example**:
```python
from src.audio_recorder import SimpleRecorder

recorder = SimpleRecorder()
success = recorder.record_5_seconds("data/recordings/my_sound.wav")
```

### Feature 2: Model Training

**Files**: `src/model_trainer.py`, `src/audio_utils.py`

**Key Components**:
- `SoundModelTrainer`: Core training functionality
- `SimpleTrainer`: Easy-to-use training interface
- Feature extraction using MFCC (Mel-frequency cepstral coefficients)

**Functionality**:
- Extract audio features from recorded files
- Train machine learning models (Random Forest)
- Save and load trained models
- Predict sound types from audio files
- Model evaluation and reporting

**Training Process**:
1. Load audio recordings from `data/recordings/`
2. Extract MFCC features from each recording
3. Use filename prefix as sound type label
4. Train Random Forest classifier
5. Save model to `data/models/`

**Usage Example**:
```python
from src.model_trainer import SimpleTrainer

trainer = SimpleTrainer()
success = trainer.train_and_save("my_model.pkl")
```

### Feature 3: Real-time Detection

**Files**: `src/sound_detector.py`, `src/model_trainer.py`

**Key Components**:
- `RealTimeDetector`: Core detection functionality
- `SimpleDetector`: Easy-to-use detection interface
- `DetectionLogger`: Log detection events

**Functionality**:
- Continuously monitor microphone input
- Analyze audio segments in real-time
- Apply trained model for sound recognition
- Provide detection alerts and logging
- Configurable confidence thresholds

**Detection Process**:
1. Record short audio segments (3 seconds)
2. Extract features from each segment
3. Apply trained model for prediction
4. Filter by confidence threshold
5. Trigger alerts for detected sounds

**Usage Example**:
```python
from src.sound_detector import SimpleDetector

detector = SimpleDetector("data/models/my_model.pkl")
detector.start_monitoring("doorbell", duration=30)
```

## User Interface

**File**: `src/gui.py`

**Features**:
- Tabbed interface for all three features
- Recording tab with sound type input and file management
- Training tab with model training and testing
- Detection tab with real-time monitoring
- Progress indicators and status updates

**Usage**:
```bash
python main.py
```

## Testing

### Basic Test
```bash
python test_recording.py
```
Tests Feature 1 (recording) functionality.

### Comprehensive Test
```bash
python test_all_features.py
```
Tests all three features in sequence:
1. Records test audio
2. Trains a model on recordings
3. Tests real-time detection

## Technical Details

### Audio Processing
- **Format**: WAV files, 44.1kHz, 16-bit, mono
- **Duration**: 5 seconds for recordings, 3 seconds for detection
- **Features**: MFCC with 13 coefficients
- **Library**: librosa for feature extraction

### Machine Learning
- **Algorithm**: Random Forest Classifier
- **Features**: Flattened MFCC coefficients
- **Validation**: 80/20 train/test split
- **Library**: scikit-learn

### Real-time Processing
- **Sampling**: Continuous microphone monitoring
- **Analysis**: Sliding window approach
- **Threading**: Non-blocking detection loop
- **Performance**: Configurable detection intervals

## Dependencies

Core dependencies (see `requirements.txt`):
- `pyaudio`: Audio recording and playback
- `librosa`: Audio feature extraction
- `scikit-learn`: Machine learning
- `numpy`: Numerical computations
- `tkinter`: GUI (built-in with Python)

## Installation and Setup

1. **Install dependencies**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. **Test basic functionality**:
   ```bash
   python test_recording.py
   ```

3. **Run comprehensive test**:
   ```bash
   python test_all_features.py
   ```

4. **Launch GUI application**:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage Workflow

1. **Record Sounds**: Use the Recording tab to capture different sound types
2. **Train Model**: Use the Training tab to train a recognition model
3. **Detect Sounds**: Use the Detection tab to monitor for specific sounds

## Extensibility

The modular design allows easy extension:

- **New Audio Formats**: Modify `audio_utils.py`
- **Different ML Models**: Extend `model_trainer.py`
- **Enhanced GUI**: Modify `gui.py`
- **Additional Features**: Add new modules to `src/`

## Performance Considerations

- **Memory**: Audio segments are processed in chunks
- **CPU**: Feature extraction is optimized for real-time use
- **Storage**: Recordings and models are saved efficiently
- **Accuracy**: Configurable confidence thresholds for detection

## Troubleshooting

Common issues and solutions:
- **PyAudio installation**: Use `pipwin install pyaudio` on Windows
- **Microphone access**: Check system permissions
- **Model training**: Ensure sufficient recordings (2+ per class)
- **Detection accuracy**: Adjust confidence thresholds

## Future Enhancements

Potential improvements:
- Support for more audio formats
- Advanced ML models (CNN, LSTM)
- Cloud-based model training
- Mobile app integration
- Sound visualization features
